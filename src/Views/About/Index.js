                    As a socially responsible company, Emirates Auction has
                    always ensured that it makes valuable contributions to the
                    community. In recent years, it has supported the cause of
                    the poor, needy and unprivledged members of society through
                    well-known and reputed philanthropic organizations. Emirates
                    Auction raised over AED 150,000 during an auction held at
                    the end of Beyond Borders – an Emirati television
                    documentary series – to provide the Philippines disaster
                    relief through the UAE Red Crescent. In 2015 a charity
                    auction organized by Emirates Auction listed a helmet worn
                    by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE
                    Vice President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai during
                    their victory at the 2012 International Federation for
                    Equestrian Sports (FEI) World Endurance Championships. This
                    helmet was auctioned for AED 24 Million and was awarded the
                    most expensive helmet sold in an auction. The total fund of
                    AED 89.8 million raised during the charity auction was
                    donated to the Al Jalila Foundation, a UAE-based global
                    philanthropic organization. Emirates Auction continues to
                    donate regularly to charitable organizations such as Dubai
                    Cares and the Red Crescent Society to bring about meaningful
                    changes in the lives of underprivileged people.
